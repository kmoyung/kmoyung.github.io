## Hi There!

I'm Kevin Moyung, a fourth-year undergraduate at ![UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu) studying **Biology with a Specialization in Bioinformatics**. I'm also a member of the ![Insel Lab](http://insellab.ucsd.edu) and am currently planning on pursuing a PhD in Bioinformatics next year.

My research interests include cancer bioinformatics, translational research, and machine learning.
