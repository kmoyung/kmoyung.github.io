## Hi There!

I'm pursuing a [PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://genome.duke.edu/education/CBB) at [Duke University](http://duke.edu), and am part of the [MacAlpine Lab](http://macalpine-lab.duhs.duke.edu/)  (Co-advised with Alex Hartemink). I'm trying to understand how chromatin organization plays a role in transcriptional regulation.
