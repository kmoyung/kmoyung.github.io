## Hi There!

I'm currently a Computational Biologist at [Tavros Therapeutics](https://www.tavrostx.com/). I completed my [PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://genome.duke.edu/education/CBB) at [Duke University](http://duke.edu), and was a part of the [MacAlpine Lab](http://macalpine-lab.duhs.duke.edu/)  (Co-advised with Alex Hartemink). My PhD research involved deciphering chromatin-mediated mechanisms of gene regulation, specifically in transcription.
