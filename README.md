## Hi There!

I'm Kevin Moyung, a fourth-year undergraduate at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu) studying **Bioinformatics**. I'm also a member of the [Insel Lab](http://insellab.ucsd.edu).

I will be pursuing a **PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics** this Fall.

My research interests include cancer bioinformatics, translational research, and machine learning.
