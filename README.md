## Hi There!

I'm pursuing a [PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://genome.duke.edu/education/CBB) at [Duke University](http://duke.edu).

Currently, I'm rotating with [Greg Wray](https://sites.duke.edu/wraylab/), where I'm doing trajectory analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data in sea urchin development.

My research interests include cancer genomics, translational research, and machine learning.
