## Hi There!

I am currently pursuing a [PhD in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://genome.duke.edu/education/CBB) at [Duke University](http://duke.edu).

I completed my undergraduate degree at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), where I studied the role of G protein-coupled receptors in cancer at the [Insel Lab](http://insellab.ucsd.edu).

My research interests include cancer genomics, translational research, and machine learning.
