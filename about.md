## About Me

I'm a Bay Area native and have lived in California all my life. I moved across the country to North Carolina, where I'm currently pursuing my PhD. I'm a sucker for boba/bubble tea and food.

My interests include weightlifting, video games, traveling, and listening to music (my favorite genre right now is city pop).
