## About Me

I'm a Bay Area native and have lived in California all my life. I moved across the country to North Carolina and completed my PhD in 2024. I'm a sucker for boba/bubble tea and food.   

I completed my undergraduate degree at [UC San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), where I studied the role of G protein-coupled receptors in cancer in the [Insel Lab](http://insellab.ucsd.edu).   

My hobbies include weightlifting, tennis, basketball, video games, traveling, and listening to music (my favorite genre right now is city pop).
